## 🚀 About Me
- 🎓 **M.S. in Computer Science, University at Buffalo** — graduated **June 2025**
- 🧰 **3+ years @ HSBC** — Senior Software Engineer on Endpoint Management & Tooling for ~400k+ devices
- 🧠 Blend of **backend engineering** (.NET 8, EF Core, SQL) and **ML systems** (Vision Transformers, NLP)
- 💡 Interests: **FinTech, platform engineering, data platforms, AI‑augmented developer tools**

## 🔧 Tech Stack
**Languages:** C#, Python, SQL, TypeScript/JavaScript

**Backend:** .NET 8, ASP.NET Core Web API, EF Core, REST, gRPC, Background Services

**Data & Infra:** SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, Linux, CI/CD (GitHub Actions/Azure DevOps)

**ML/AI:** PyTorch, scikit‑learn, ViT, Transformers, FAISS, OpenAI API

**Frontend:** React, Vite, MUI (learning Next.js)

**Testing & Quality:** xUnit/NUnit, Integration Tests, Serilog, Postman

## 🧭 What I’m Focused On (now)
- Building a **Splitwise‑style expense manager** (React + .NET API) with equal/unequal/% splits & group ledgers
- Improving **PixeLens**: ViT encoder + Transformer decoder with beam search; semantic search via FAISS
- **RT‑Extension‑AI** for Request Tracker: ticket summarization, sentiment, and smart reply drafting (OpenAI)
- Writing succinct systems articles (Memcache vs Redis, caches at scale)

---

## 🌟 Featured Projects

### 1) SmartHub — Enterprise Backup/Restore Platform  
**Stack:** .NET / C# • Windows services • SQL Server • Task Scheduler • Serilog  
**Highlights:**
- Loads backup schedules from DB as JSON; runs per‑user restores across multiple machines  
- Supports multilingual UI text, dynamic config updates, and login/startup triggers  
- Designed for **scale & resilience** across a large enterprise footprint

> Impact: Reduced restore time & support friction for thousands of employees.

---

### 2) RT‑Extension‑AI (Open‑Source Contribution)  
**Stack:** Perl • JavaScript/CKEditor • OpenAI API  
**What it does:** AI add‑on for the open‑source **Request Tracker** issue system—adds ticket **summaries**, **sentiment analysis**, and **auto‑completion** for replies, improving agent productivity.

> Why it’s cool: Real‑world OSS impact; blends classic Perl stack with modern LLMs.

---

### 3) PixeLens — Vision Captioning & Semantic Search  
**Stack:** PyTorch • ViT‑B/16 encoder • Transformer decoder • FAISS • Flask/FastAPI • SQLite  
**Features:**  
- Trainable on Flickr‑8k; **beam search** decoding; BLEU/METEOR evaluation  
- **Image↔Text** and **Image↔Image** semantic retrieval via embedding search (FAISS)  
- Responsive web UI; export captions & results

> Why it shines: Showcases end‑to‑end ML product engineering.

---

### 4) Splitwise‑Clone — Group Expense Manager  
**Stack:** React • Vite • MUI • Axios • .NET 8 Web API • EF Core • PostgreSQL  
**Capabilities:** Equal/unequal/percent splits, member balances, month‑wise grouping, and clean Group Detail UX.

> Goal: Demonstrate pragmatic **full‑stack** engineering in FinTech‑style workflows.
